From the archive (stable version)
---------------------------------

1.  You must have a web server with PHP installed
2.  Download the [source
    code](https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/releases/latest) and copy
    the directory `kanboard` where you want
3.  Check if the directory `data` is writeable by the web server user
4.  With your browser go to `http://yourpersonalserver/kanboard`
5.  The default login and password is **admin/admin**
6.  Start using the software
7.  Don't forget to change your password!

The `data` folder is used to store:

- Sqlite database: `db.sqlite`
- Debug file: `debug.log` (if debug mode is enabled with the `file` driver)
- Uploaded files: `files/*`
- Image thumbnails: `files/thumbnails/*`

People who are using a remote database (Mysql/Postgresql) and object
storage (AWS S3 or similar) don't necessarily need to have a persistent
local data folder or to change the permissions for the folder.

From the git repository (development version)
---------------------------------------------

1. `git clone https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard.git`
2. Go to the third step just above

Note: This method will install the **current development version**, use at your own risk.
